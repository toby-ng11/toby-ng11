**Hey there! I'm a tech tinkerer who loves:**

- ✨ Experimenting with new ideas
- 💻 Writing code that actually works (most of the time)
- 🎶 Listening to indie folk tunes (Bon Iver is my favourite artist).



**When not in front of a screen, I’m probably:**

- 🛠️ Building something just for fun
- 🌌 Daydreaming about the next cool project
- 🎨 Getting creative in my own weird ways

**Life motto: Keep learning 📚, stay curious 🔍, and sprinkle a little fun everywhere! 🎈**
